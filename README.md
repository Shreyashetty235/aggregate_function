# aggregate_function

COUNT() → Counts rows
SUM() → Adds numeric values
AVG() → Calculates average
GROUP BY → Groups similar records
HAVING → Filters grouped results
These functions help summarize large datasets into meaningful insights like total sales, average performance, and grouped statistics.

In this task,I worked with SQL aggregate functions to summarize and analyze data from a sample Orders table. 
The main objective was to understand how functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and AVG() are used along with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to generate meaningful insights from structured data.
